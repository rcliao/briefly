## How It Works

### Digest Generation (v2.0 Enhanced)

1. **URL Extraction**: Parses the input Markdown file to find all HTTP/HTTPS URLs
2. **Content Fetching**: Downloads and extracts main content from each URL using intelligent HTML parsing
3. **Smart Caching**: Checks cache for previously processed articles to avoid redundant API calls
4. **Content Cleaning**: Removes boilerplate content (navigation, ads, etc.) to focus on main article text
5. **AI Summarization**: Uses Gemini API to generate word-limited summaries (15-25 words per article)
6. **🎯 v2.0 Relevance Filtering**: 
   - **Theme Detection**: Automatically infers digest theme from article titles and content
   - **Relevance Scoring**: Uses KeywordScorer to evaluate content relevance with configurable weights
   - **Quality Filtering**: Removes low-quality content (short articles, spam domains, missing titles)
   - **Threshold Filtering**: Keeps only articles meeting minimum relevance score (default 0.6)
   - **Word Budget Management**: Prioritizes high-relevance content when approaching word limits
7. **AI-Powered Insights Generation**: Automatically analyzes filtered content for:
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines emotional tone and assigns appropriate emoji indicators
   - **Alert Evaluation**: Checks configured alert conditions against article content and topics
   - **Trend Detection**: Compares current topics with historical data when available
   - **Research Suggestions**: Generates AI-driven research queries for deeper topic exploration
8. **🎯 v2.0 Actionable Recommendations**: Generates "⚡ Try This Week" section with 2-3 specific, technology-aware action items
9. **Template Processing**: Applies word-optimized format templates with integrated insights and recommendations
10. **Word Count Optimization**: Ensures output meets target word limits (200-500 words) with read time estimates
11. **Final Digest Generation**: Creates cohesive, scannable digest with proper citations and comprehensive sections
12. **Output**: Saves the final digest as a Markdown file with word count statistics and filtering results

### AI-Powered Insights

Every digest automatically includes a comprehensive "AI-Powered Insights" section featuring:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: 
   - Analyzes the emotional tone of each article using AI
   - Displays sentiment with emoji indicators (😊 positive, 😞 negative, 🤔 neutral/mixed)
   - Provides overall digest sentiment summary

2. **Alert Monitoring**:
   - Evaluates configurable alert conditions against article content
   - Triggers notifications for high-priority topics or keywords
   - Displays triggered alerts with context and priority levels

3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Compares current digest topics with historical data when available
   - Identifies emerging themes and topic frequency changes
   - Provides week-over-week trend insights

4. **Deep Research Suggestions**:
   - AI generates relevant research queries based on digest content
   - Provides suggestions for deeper exploration of covered topics
   - Can automatically execute research with configurable depth using `briefly research` command

### My Take Regeneration

1. **Personal Perspective Storage**: Your "my take" is stored in the local database linked to the specific digest
2. **Content Retrieval**: System retrieves the original digest content and your personal take
3. **AI-Powered Rewriting**: Gemini LLM receives sophisticated prompts to completely rewrite the digest incorporating your voice naturally throughout
4. **Cohesive Integration**: Your perspective becomes part of the narrative flow rather than a separate section
5. **Timestamped Output**: Creates a new file with `_with_my_take_` suffix while preserving the original

### Intelligent Features

- **Caching**: Articles and summaries are cached to avoid re-processing
- **Content Extraction**: Advanced HTML parsing focuses on main article content
- **Cost Estimation**: Dry-run mode provides cost estimates before processing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of failed URLs with detailed logging
- **Multiple Formats**: Choose from different digest styles for various use cases
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Automatic sentiment analysis, alert monitoring, trend detection, and research suggestions
- **Alert System**: Configurable conditions for monitoring specific topics, keywords, or content patterns
- **Research Integration**: AI-driven deep research capabilities with iterative topic exploration

## Advanced Usage

### Configuration Management

Create a `.briefly.yaml` configuration file for persistent settings:

```yaml
# Gemini AI Configuration
gemini:
  api_key: ""  # Or use GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20"

# Output Configuration
output:
  directory: "digests"

# Future configuration options can be added here
# cache:
#   enabled: true
#   ttl: "24h"
```

### Development and Testing

```bash
# Run from source during development
go run ./cmd/briefly digest input/test-links.md

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Build for multiple platforms
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o briefly-linux-amd64 ./cmd/briefly
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o briefly-windows-amd64.exe ./cmd/briefly
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o briefly-darwin-amd64 ./cmd/briefly
```

### API Cost Management

Briefly includes built-in cost estimation to help manage Gemini API usage:

```bash
# Estimate costs before processing
briefly digest --dry-run input/large-link-list.md

# Example output:
# Cost Estimation for Digest Generation
# =====================================
# Articles to process: 25
# Estimated tokens per article: ~2000
# Total estimated input tokens: ~50,000
# Estimated output tokens: ~5,000
# 
# Estimated costs (USD):
# - Input tokens: $0.025
# - Output tokens: $0.015
# - Total estimated cost: $0.040
```

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **API Key not found**: Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set or configured in `.briefly.yaml`
2. **Permission denied**: Make sure the output directory is writable
3. **Network timeouts**: Some websites may be slow or block requests
4. **Cache issues**: Clear cache with `briefly cache clear --confirm`

**Debug Logging:**

The application provides detailed logging. Check logs for specific error messages when articles fail to process.
