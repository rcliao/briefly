It remembers user preferences, adapts to individual needs, and continuously learns over time—ideal for customer support chatbots, AI assistants, and autonomous systems. Key Features & Use Cases Core Capabilities: Multi-Level Memory: Seamlessly retains User, Session, and Agent state with adaptive personalization Developer-Friendly: Intuitive API, cross-platform SDKs, and a fully managed service option Applications: AI Assistants: Consistent, context-rich conversations Customer Support: Recall past tickets and user history for tailored help Healthcare: Track patient preferences and history for personalized care Productivity & Gaming: Adaptive workflows and environments based on user behavior 🚀 Quickstart Guide Choose between our hosted platform or self-hosted package: Hosted Platform Get up and running in minutes with automatic updates, analytics, and enterprise security. Sign up on Mem0 Platform Embed the memory layer via SDK or API keys Self-Hosted (Open Source) Install the sdk via pip: pip install mem0ai Install sdk via npm: npm install mem0ai Basic Usage Mem0 requires an LLM to function, with gpt-4o-mini from OpenAI as the default. However, it supports a variety of LLMs; for details, refer to our Supported LLMs documentation. First step is to instantiate the memory: from openai import OpenAI from mem0 import Memory openai_client = OpenAI() memory = Memory() def chat_with_memories(message: str, user_id: str = "default_user") -> str: # Retrieve relevant memories relevant_memories = memory.search(query=message, user_id=user_id, limit=3) memories_str = "\n".join(f"- {entry['memory']}" for entry in relevant_memories["results"]) # Generate Assistant response system_prompt = f"You are a helpful AI. Answer the question based on query and memories.\nUser Memories:\n{memories_str}" messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}, {"role": "user", "content": message}] response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=messages) assistant_response = response.choices[0].message.content # Create new memories from the conversation messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_response}) memory.add(messages, user_id=user_id) return assistant_response def main(): print("Chat with AI (type 'exit' to quit)") while True: user_input = input("You: ").strip() if user_input.lower() == 'exit': print("Goodbye!") break print(f"AI: {chat_with_memories(user_input)}") if __name__ == "__main__": main() For detailed integration steps, see the Quickstart and API Reference. 🔗 Integrations & Demos ChatGPT with Memory: Personalized chat powered by Mem0 (Live Demo) Browser Extension: Store memories across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude (Chrome Extension) Langgraph Support: Build a customer bot with Langgraph + Mem0 (Guide) CrewAI Integration: Tailor CrewAI outputs with Mem0 (Example) 📚 Documentation & Support Full docs: https://docs.mem0.ai Community: Discord · Twitter Contact: founders@mem0.ai Citation We now have a paper you can cite: @article{mem0, title={Mem0: Building Production-Ready AI Agents with Scalable Long-Term Memory}, author={Chhikara, Prateek and Khant, Dev and Aryan, Saket and Singh, Taranjeet and Yadav, Deshraj}, journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.19413}, year={2025} } ⚖️ License Apache 2.0 — see the LICENSE file for details.
