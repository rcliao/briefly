May 10, 20250.50Simplified Pricing, Background Agent and Refreshed Inline EditIntroducing unified request-based pricing, Max Mode for all top models, and Background Agent for parallel task execution. Plus, improved context management with @folders support, refreshed Inline Edit with new options, faster file edits, multi-root workspace support, and enhanced chat features including export and duplication. Simpler, unified pricing We've heard your feedback and are rolling out a unified pricing model to make it less confusing. Here's how it works: All model usage is now unified into request-based pricing Max mode now uses token-based pricing (similar to how models API pricing works) Premium tool calls and long context mode are removed to keep it simple Quotas on plans Hobby, Pro and Business has not changed and slow requests are still included in the plans. All usage can be found in your dashboard to help you track and manage your spend. Max Mode for all top models Max Mode is now available for all state-of-the-art models in Cursor, with a simpler token-based pricing model. It's designed to give you full control when you need it most. You can enable it from the model picker to see which models support it. When new models roll out, Max Mode will be how we deliver their full capabilities from day one. It's ideal for your hardest problems when you need more context, intelligence and tool use. For everything else, normal mode is still recommended with the same capabilities you're used to. The pricing is straightforward: you're charged based on token usage. If you've used any CLI-based coding tool, Max mode will feel like that - but right in Cursor. Note: If you're using an older version of Cursor, you'll still have access to the previous MAX versions and long context mode for a few weeks. However, these features will be sunset soon, so we recommend updating to continue using these capabilities. Read more about Max Mode in our documentation Your browser does not support the video tag. New Tab model We've trained a new Tab model that now can suggest changes across multiple files. The model excels particularly at refactors, edit chains, multi file changes, and jumping between related code. You'll also notice it feels more natural and snappier in day-to-day use. With this we've also added syntax highlighting to the completion suggestions. Background Agent Preview In early preview, rolling out gradually: Cursor agents can now run in the background! To try it, head to Settings > Beta > Background Agent. This allows you to run many agents in parallel and have them tackle bigger tasks. The agents run in their own remote environments. At any point, you can view the status, send a follow-up, or take over. We're curious to hear what you think. While it is still early, we've found background agents useful internally for fixing nits, doing investigations, and writing first drafts of medium-sized PRs.

Include your entire codebase in context You can now use @folders to add your entire codebase into context, just make sure to enable Full folder contents from settings. If a folder (or file) is too large to be included, you'll see a small icon on the context pill indicating this. Your browser does not support the video tag. Refreshed Inline Edit (Cmd/Ctrl+K) with Agent integration Inline Edit (Cmd/Ctrl+K) has gotten a UI refresh and new options for full file edits (⌘⇧⏎) and sending to agent (⌘L) Full file makes it easy to do scope changes to a file without using agent. However, you might come across cases where you're working with a piece of code you want to make multi-file edits to or simply just want more control you can get from agent. That's when you want to send selected codeblock to agent and keep on editing from there. Your browser does not support the video tag. Fast edits for long files with Agent We've added a new tool to the agent that will search & replace code in files, making it much more efficient for long files. Instead of reading the complete file, Agent can now find the exact place where edits should occur and change only that part. Here's an example editing a file in Postgres codebase where using search & replace tool is nearly double as fast. We're rolling this out to Anthropic models first and will expand to other models soon. Your browser does not support the video tag. Work in multiple codebases with workspaces Now you can create multi-root workspaces to make multiple codebases available to Cursor. All of them will be indexed and available to Cursor, ideal when you have projects in different folders you want to work on in the same space. .cursor/rules are supported in all folders added Working with Chat Exporting Chat You can now export chats to markdown from the chat view. Text and code blocks are included in the final export. Your browser does not support the video tag. Duplicate Chats Exploring different paths from a conversation while preserving the existing is now possible with chat duplication. Go to a message and start a new chat from the three dots menu. Your browser does not support the video tag.
