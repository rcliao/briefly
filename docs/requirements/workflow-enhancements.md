## Overview

This document outlines the next phase of Briefly development focused on streamlining personal productivity workflows through a simplified two-command architecture (`digest` + `research`), expanding content format support, and enhancing visual presentation. The goal is to reduce command complexity, handle diverse content types, provide intelligent research capabilities, and create visually engaging digests while maintaining the tool's focus as a personal productivity solution with manual content curation control.

## Problem Statement

### Current Workflow Friction
1. **Command Complexity**: Too many specialized commands (15+) when core workflows could be simplified to 2 primary commands
2. **Manual My-Take Process**: The digest → my-take add → regenerate cycle requires multiple commands and context switching
3. **Limited Content Types**: Only HTML content via HTTP GET, missing PDFs and YouTube videos
4. **Research and Discovery**: No systematic way to discover and evaluate content before manual curation
5. **Team Sharing Overhead**: No optimized format for quick team communication
6. **Visual Presentation**: Plain text digests lack visual appeal for sharing and engagement

### User Context
- **Primary Use Case**: Personal weekly newsletter generation with manual content curation
- **Secondary Use Case**: Occasional team sharing via Slack (short format)
- **Content Sources**: Web articles, PDFs (research papers), YouTube videos
- **Research Needs**: Systematic content discovery and evaluation through feeds and topic research
- **Workflow Preference**: Review and manually select content before digest generation
- **Command Simplicity**: Prefer minimal command surface area (2 primary commands)
- **Long-term Vision**: Intelligent research capabilities feeding manual curation decisions with engaging visual presentation

## Simplified Command Architecture

### Two-Command Structure

**Primary Commands**:
1. **`digest`** - Content processing and output generation
2. **`research`** - Content discovery and investigation

**Utility Commands** (minimal):
- `cache` - Cache management
- `tui` - Terminal user interface

### Target User Workflow
1. **Discovery**: `briefly research "topic"` or `briefly research --from-feeds` → generates research reports
2. **Manual Curation**: User reads research reports, manually selects interesting URLs
3. **Digest Creation**: Add selected URLs to input.md → `briefly digest input.md --interactive`
4. **Team Sharing**: `briefly digest --format slack input.md` for quick team communication

## Requirements

### Sprint 1: Command Consolidation & Streamlined Workflow

- Absorb `formats` functionality into `digest --list-formats`
- Remove standalone `my-take` commands in favor of interactive workflow
- Remove `sentiment`, `insights`, `trends` commands (functionality moved to research)

**New Digest Command Interface**:
```bash
# Core digest generation
briefly digest [input.md]                    # Standard digest
briefly digest --format slack [input.md]     # Slack copy-paste format  
briefly digest --format email [input.md]     # HTML email

## Architecture Refactoring Requirements

### Current Architecture Analysis

**Strengths**:
- 22% test coverage (10/45 Go files) with passing unit tests
- Clean core package with zero external dependencies
- Interface-driven design in search package
- No circular dependencies
- Layered architecture with proper separation of concerns

**Critical Issues Identified**:
1. **Monolithic Command Structure**: Single 2,929-line `cmd/cmd/root.go` file importing 20+ internal packages
2. **Legacy Technical Debt**: Dual LLM clients (`internal/llm` + `llmclient/`) with incomplete migration
3. **Missing Service Interfaces**: No interfaces for core services, making testing and mocking difficult
4. **Tight Template-LLM Coupling**: Templates package directly calls LLM, violating single responsibility

### Architecture Refactoring Phases

#### Phase 1: Command Layer Refactoring (Sprint 1 Integration)
**Objective**: Split monolithic command structure to align with simplified 2-command architecture.

**Functional Requirements**:
- Split `cmd/cmd/root.go` into focused command handlers
- Separate digest and research command logic
- Remove legacy `llmclient/` package completely
- Implement clean command handler pattern

**New Command Structure**:
```
cmd/
├── briefly/main.go
└── handlers/
    ├── root.go           # Minimal root with common setup
    ├── digest.go         # Digest command handler + formats
    ├── research.go       # Research command handler + feeds  
    └── cache.go          # Cache command handler
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- Each command handler independently testable
- Shared configuration and setup in root
- Clean separation between command parsing and business logic
- Dependency injection for service dependencies

#### Phase 2: Service Layer Introduction (Sprint 2 Integration)
**Objective**: Add service interfaces for better testability and separation of concerns.

**Service Interface Design**:
```go
// internal/services/interfaces.go
type DigestService interface {
    GenerateDigest(ctx context.Context, urls []string, format string) (*core.Digest, error)
}

type ArticleProcessor interface {
    ProcessArticle(ctx context.Context, url string) (*core.Article, error)
}

type TemplateRenderer interface {
    Render(ctx context.Context, digest *core.Digest, format string) (string, error)
}

type ResearchService interface {
    PerformResearch(ctx context.Context, query string, depth int) (*core.ResearchReport, error)
}
```

**Implementation Structure**:
```
internal/
├── services/
│   ├── interfaces.go     # Service contracts
│   ├── digest.go        # DigestService implementation
│   ├── processor.go     # ArticleProcessor implementation
│   ├── research.go      # ResearchService implementation
│   └── renderer.go      # TemplateRenderer implementation
```

#### Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure (Sprint 2-3 Integration)
**Objective**: Comprehensive testing framework supporting mocks and integration tests.

**Testing Structure**:
```
test/
├── integration/
│   ├── digest_test.go    # End-to-end digest generation
│   ├── research_test.go  # Research workflow tests
│   └── fixtures/         # Test data and mocks

└── testdata/
    ├── sample_articles/  # Test HTML files
    ├── sample_pdfs/      # Test PDF files  
    ├── sample_videos/    # Test video metadata
    └── expected_outputs/ # Golden files for comparison
```

**Test Coverage Goals**:
- Unit tests: 80%+ coverage for all packages
- Integration tests: Core workflows (digest generation, research)
- Contract tests: Interface compliance testing
- End-to-end tests: CLI command testing with mocked external dependencies

#### Phase 4: Package Reorganization (Future Sprint)
**Objective**: Optimize package structure for maintainability and clarity.

**Proposed Reorganization**:
```
