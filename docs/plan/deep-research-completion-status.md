## 📋 Implementation Status Summary

The deep research feature has been **fully implemented** according to the PRD specifications. All functional requirements (F-1 through F-11) have been completed and the system is ready for production use.

### ✅ Completed Requirements

| Requirement | Status | Implementation Details |
|------------|--------|----------------------|
| **F-1** CLI Command | ✅ Complete | `briefly deep-research <topic>` with all flags implemented |
| **F-2** Time & Size Filters | ✅ Complete | `--since` and `--max-sources` flags working |
| **F-3** Topic Decomposition | ✅ Complete | LLM planner generates 3-7 sub-questions |
| **F-4** Search Integration | ✅ Complete | DuckDuckGo + SerpAPI providers with time filters |
| **F-5** Content Fetching | ✅ Complete | HTML cleaning, SQLite caching with sha256 hashing |
| **F-6** Source Ranking | ✅ Complete | Relevance scoring and diversity filtering |
| **F-7** Research Synthesis | ✅ Complete | Executive summary, findings, citations, open questions |
| **F-8** Multiple Outputs | ✅ Complete | Markdown (stdout), JSON artifacts, optional HTML |
| **F-9** Chat Integration | ✅ Ready | Slug-based files ready for TUI chat integration |
| **F-10** Cache Control | ✅ Complete | `--refresh` flag bypasses cache |
| **F-11** Error Handling | ✅ Complete | Graceful degradation with error collection |

### ✅ Non-Functional Requirements Met

- **Performance**: Architecture supports <2min generation time
- **Cost**: Uses efficient Gemini models with caching
- **Observability**: Structured logging throughout pipeline
- **Extensibility**: Interface-based design for swappable components
- **Security**: Rate limiting and respectful scraping

## 🎯 Current Capabilities

The implementation provides:

```bash
# Core functionality
briefly deep-research "AI agent frameworks"

# Advanced options
briefly deep-research "sustainable energy" \
  --since 7d \
  --max-sources 30 \
  --html \
  --model gemini-1.5-pro \
  --search-provider serpapi \
  --refresh
```

**Output Generated:**
- `research/ai-agent-frameworks.md` - Human-readable research brief
- `research/ai-agent-frameworks.json` - Machine-readable data 
- `research/ai-agent-frameworks.html` - Web-ready format (optional)
- Console output for immediate review
